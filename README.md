## BeyondWords iOS Player

**Note:** This is a beta version of the new player that weâ€™re sharing with customers as we finalize its documentation.


BeyondWords is an AI voice and audio CMS that enables publishers to transform their content into natural-sounding and captivating audio experiences for their audiences.
This repository includes the BeyondWords player, which seamlessly integrates with the BeyondWords audio CMS and can be easily embedded into your website or app. You can create an account
[here](https://dash.beyondwords.io/auth/signup).

The easiest way to embed the BeyondWords player into your app is by copying
the player snippet inside the BeyondWords CMS. However, for those who wish to
customize the player further, this documentation provides helpful guides and a
detailed explanation for each of the player's settings. You can see a demo of
the player
[here](./Example).

BeyondWords iOS Player is built on top of the [BeyondWords Web Player](https://github.com/BeyondWords-io/player) by running it into a WkWebView and bind it to Swift/Obj-C.
